        <h4>What is HTML?</h4>

        <h4>How to use HTML</h4>
        <h5>HTML uses tags to define elements. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets. Elements can include headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists.</h5>
        <h5>HTML documents are structured with a basic layout, including a HEAD section for metadata and a BODY section for content.</h5>
