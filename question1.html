        <h2>Verse 1:</h2>
        <h4>All that I have is all that you've given me<br>
        Did you never worry that I'd come to depend on you<br>
        I gave you all the love I had in me<br>
        Now I find you've lied and I can't believe it's true<br>
        <img src="./img.liar.jpeg" alt="Liar">
        Wrapped in her arms I see you across the street<br>
        And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on<br>
        You talk of love but you don't know how it feels<br>
        When you realize that you're not the only one<br></h4>
        
        <h2>Chorus:</h2>

        <h2>Verse 2:</h2>
        <h4>Time after time I've tried to walk away<br>
        (I've tried to walk away)<br>
        But it's not that easy when your soul is torn in two<br>
        So I just resign myself to it every day<br>
        Now all I can do is to leave it up to you<br></h4>
        
        <h2>Chorus:</h2>
        <ul>
