        <h3>Verse 1</h3>
        <h5>In a room full of dimes<br>
        You would be a hundred dollars<br>
        If bein' fine was a crime<br>
        Girl, they'd lock your lil' fine ass up in a tower<br>
        The way you move like you do<br>
        Ooh, it's like you do it for a livin'<br>
        Do a lil' spin, do it again<br>
        Shit, look like you playin' for the win, oh, baby<br>

        <h3>Pre-chorus</h3>
        <h5>I'm tryna roll, I'm tryna ride<br>
        I'm tryna float, I'm tryna glide<br>
        No, no, don't be shy, just take my hand and hold on tight<br>

        <h3>Chorus</h3>
        <h5>Oh, skate to me, baby (Skate)<br>
        Slide your way on over (Slide your way on over)<br>
        Oh, skate to me, baby (Skate)<br>
        I wanna get to know ya (I wanna get to know ya)<br>
        Come on<br>
        Oh my, oh my<br>

        <h3>Verse 2</h3>
        <h5>Got your hair in the wind and your skin glistenin'<br>
        I can smell your sweet perfume<br>
        Mmm, you smell better than a barbecue<br>
        Oh, superstar is what you are<br>
        I'm your biggest fan<br>
        If you're lookin' for a man, sugar, here I am<br>
        Ooh<br>
            
        <h3>Pre-chorus</h3>

        And only you, you<br>
        I'm reachin' out in hopes that you reach for me too<br>
        Girl, let's groove<br>
        Girl, you got me singin' "Ooh"<br>
        My, oh my, my, oh my<br>
        My, oh my, my, oh my<br>
